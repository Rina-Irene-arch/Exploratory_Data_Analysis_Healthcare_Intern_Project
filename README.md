# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Healthcare_Intern_Project
This repository contains an internship project focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of smartwatch-collected physiological data. The goal is to investigate the potential for detecting and alerting users to drowsiness based on their biometric information.

Project Overview
Exploring Drowsiness Patterns in Wearable Device Data
- Background: A wearable technology company produces smartwatches with vital signs sensors. These sensors monitor heart rate and PPG (Photoplethysmography) signals, which include variations in green, red, and infrared light. One of the key features of the company's smartwatch is its ability to detect and alert users to potential drowsiness based on their physiological data.

- Objective: The task is to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset collected from these smartwatches. The dataset includes various physiological parameters along with a 'drowsiness' label, which indicates the level of sleepiness based on an adapted Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS).
